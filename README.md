# Information
This project follows https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/, but with some tweaks from the Internet to get it working.
It is also based on a Product, instead of an Employee. It might also be based on an ancient npm & nodejs version in the pom.file. Feel free to change them.
Run:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
``` 
This will install npm and nodejs locally. If you have them already, you can go into the root folder and run
``` 
npx webpack
```
Otherwise, you will have to do it later. After webpack you can rerun the mvwn command.
